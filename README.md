# Beijing-PM2.5-Air-Quality-Prediction
This machine learning project explores air quality in Beijing from 2010 to 2014, focusing on predicting fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and how it evolves over time in relation to meteorological and seasonal factors. The dataset is a time series, with hourly readings of PM2.5 and weather conditions such as temperature, wind speed, and pressure.
